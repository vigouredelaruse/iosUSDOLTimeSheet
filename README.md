DOL-Timesheet - forked from https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/DOL-Timesheet
=============

This is a *(fork!)* timesheet to record the hours that you work and calculate the amount you may be owed by your employer. It also includes overtime pay calculations at a rate of one and one-half times (1.5) the regular rate of pay for all hours you work over 40 in a workweek. This DOL-Timesheet does not handle items such as tips, commissions, bonuses, deductions, holiday pay, pay for weekends, shift differentials, or pay for regular days of rest.

WIP
- multiple concurrent jobs
- longer job descriptions
